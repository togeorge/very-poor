'I Read My Cheating Fiance's Texts Instead Of My Vows At Our Wedding'
I (Stacey) stood at the front of the room in my wedding dress and looked out at the excited faces of our friends and family. My hands were shaking, but not nearly as much as my insides quivered.
This was supposed to be the happiest day of my life, instead, I knew it was the end of my dream relationship and everyone was going to witness it.
Alex* and I had been together for six years. I felt he was The One instantly. Our families became friends, our lives were entwined, and I believed we’d live happily ever after.
The text message that changed everything
"On the last night of my unwed life, I was with hanging out my best friends in a glitzy hotel room. My phone buzzed from across the room and I did a silly sashay with my glass in my hand to go and retrieve it.
“Phone is running hot tonight,” commented one of my bridesmaids.
But this text wasn’t like the other wishes of luck and love. This text took us all by surprise and changed everything in the heartbeat.
The message was a series of screenshots from a number I didn’t recognize. The accompanying message simply said, “I wouldn’t marry him. Will you?”
The screenshots were of conversations between my husband-to-be and another woman. Loads of them, including selfies of the pair. She was the opposite of me. I’m blonde and fair, and this unknown woman had dark hair and olive skin.
The texts were dated from months to only days before. My brain simply could not compute WTF was going on. There was no questioning the legitimacy of these messages. I just knew.
Suddenly, little moments added up and I realized I was a fool and he was cheating on me!
I burst into shamed and broken tears. My girls were threatening all manner of violence against him. They insisted I call him immediately and call the wedding off.
I said NO. I will make him regret he did this to me. There wont be a wedding but there will be humiliation!
The biggest secret!
One super important thing that noone but Stacey knew, was that occasionally she dabbled into online casinos, playing slot games. Not even 3 days before the weeding, during some boring planning, she noticed a post, shared by a friend, of a website called Jackpots.VIP.

Without giving it too much thought, she clicked the link and as it turned out, the website was giving away free spins to play slots at online casinos. Said and done, she collected the 80 free spins and 1 minute later was already playing slots.
Several minutes and around 50 spins later, happened the craziest thing is her life: Stacey had won the progressive jackpot of over $1,78 Millions.
"I was in loss of words, was absolutely happy. I imagined telling Alex about it but wanted to make it more special, so i had the idea to tell him during our wedding vows. Romantic move, eh? But, his affair made me so angry that i decided to humiliate him in front of everyone and also let him know he just missed becoming a millionaire!" said Stacy.

 
The bride then sped away from the reception in a top-of-the-range sports car. Stacey left her cheating groom to face the rest of his miserable life without her.

"Stacey was very lucky to have found that promotion, as the link is given only to qualified Canadians", said a representative of Jackpots.VIP, "and we are very happy that she was able to win the jackpot that changed her life towards the better".
Update: Grateful for all the free buzz, Jackpots.VIP was kind enough to offer our readers exclusive access to their offer.

However, you must act before the end of today!!

<p><span><strong><em>'I Read My Cheating Fiance's Texts Instead Of My Vows At Our Wedding'</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span>I (Stacey) stood at the front of the room in my wedding dress and looked out at the excited faces of our friends and family. My hands were shaking, but not nearly as much as my insides quivered.</span></p>
<p><span>This was supposed to be the happiest day of my life, instead, I knew it was the end of my dream relationship and everyone was going to witness it.</span></p>
<p><span>Alex* and I had been together for six years. I felt he was The One instantly. Our families became friends, our lives were entwined, and I believed we’d live happily ever after.</span></p>
<h3><span>The text message that changed everything</span></h3>
<p><span>"On the last night of my unwed life, I was with hanging out my best friends in a glitzy hotel room. My phone buzzed from across the room and I did a silly sashay with my glass in my hand to go and retrieve it.</span></p>
<p><span>“Phone is running hot tonight,” commented one of my bridesmaids.</span></p>
<p><span>But this text wasn’t like the other wishes of luck and love. This text took us all by surprise and changed everything in the heartbeat.</span></p>
<p><span>The message was a series of screenshots from a number I didn’t recognize. The accompanying message simply said, “I wouldn’t marry him. Will you?”</span></p>
<p><span>The screenshots were of conversations between my husband-to-be and another woman. Loads of them, including selfies of the pair. She was the opposite of me. I’m blonde and fair, and this unknown woman had dark hair and olive skin.</span></p>
<p><span>The texts were dated from months to only days before. My brain simply could not compute WTF was going on. There was no questioning the legitimacy of these messages. I just knew.</span></p>
<p><span>Suddenly, little moments added up and I realized I was a fool and he was cheating on me!</span></p>
<p><span>I burst into shamed and broken tears. My girls were threatening all manner of violence against him. They insisted I call him immediately and call the wedding off.</span></p>
<p><span>I said NO. I will make him regret he did this to me. <strong>There wont be a wedding but there will be humiliation!</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>The biggest secret!</strong></span></p>
<p><span>One super important thing that noone but Stacey knew, was that occasionally she dabbled into online casinos, playing slot games. Not even 3 days before the weeding, during some boring planning, she noticed a post, shared by a friend, of a website called <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;"><strong>Jackpots.VIP</strong></span>.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0235/3076/6383/files/blondcad_large.jpg?v=1571210450" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></span></p>
<p><span>Without giving it too much thought, she clicked the link and as it turned out, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fortune.surf/pages/thank-you-comeback-soon" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the website was giving away free spins to play slots at online casinos</strong></a>.</span> </span>Said and done, she collected the 80 free spins and 1 minute later was already playing slots.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://fortune.surf/pages/thank-you-comeback-soon" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-25466 size-medium" src="/wp-content/custom_export_folder/images/jpvips12-300x185.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="185"></a></span>Several minutes and around 50 spins later, happened the craziest thing is her life: <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;"><a href="https://fortune.surf/pages/thank-you-comeback-soon" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Stacey had won the progressive jackpot of over $1,78 Millions.</strong></a></span></p>
<p><span>"I was in loss of words, was absolutely happy. I imagined telling Alex about it but wanted to make it more special, so i had the idea to tell him during our wedding vows. Romantic move, eh? But, his affair made me so angry that i decided to humiliate him in front of everyone and also let him know he just missed becoming a millionaire!" said Stacy.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://fortune.surf/pages/thank-you-comeback-soon" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0235/3076/6383/files/winbanner2_large.jpg?v=1571210158" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></span></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>The bride then sped away from the reception in a top-of-the-range sports car. Stacey left her cheating groom to face the rest of his miserable life without her.</span></p>
<p><span><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-12431 aligncenter" src="https://dididaffodil.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/926/2019/08/car-1024x576.png" alt="" width="620" height="349" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></span></p>
<p>"<em>Stacey was very lucky to have found that promotion, as the link is given only to </em><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;"><strong><a style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://fortune.surf/pages/thank-you-comeback-soon" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>qualified Canadians</em>", said a representative of Jackpots.VIP</a></strong><strong>, </strong></span>"<em>and we are very happy that she was able to win the jackpot that changed her life towards the better</em>".</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Grateful for all the free buzz, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #00ffff; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="https://fortune.surf/pages/thank-you-comeback-soon" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Jackpots.VIP was kind enough to offer our readers exclusive access to their offer</strong></a></span>.</span></span></p>
